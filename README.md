Little Dues is a very simple tamagotchi style (kinda) game made for MRE based smartwatches. 
The app has been tested & made for the NO.1 G6 but probably will work just fine on similar devices.  

The basic gameplay is:
  
  - Open up the app & a pet is generated.
   You have a chance to get one of serveral personality types which effect how moody & hungry the pet will be.
   You also have a 5% chance of getting a glitch pet. Which is just a pet with odd colours.
   
   - You feed your pet with random food drops & play with it by tapping it every now & then.
   
   - Double/spam tapping your pet will show more detailed infomation.
   
   - If you neglect your pet it can die. You spawn another if you cry enough (there's a cry button).
   
 
 ### Installing
 
 Extract the zip of the lastest release into the `appmanager` folder of the Mediatek Smartwatch app. 
 Then install onto your device though the app.
 
 (or somehow get the .vxp file on your device)
